# Requirements Prompt Pack

This directory hosts the documentation-first workflow for deriving agile requirements, tagging coverage, and summarizing findings for stakeholders.

## Quick links

- [Prompt script](./prompts.md) – covers behavior mining, story drafting, gap analysis, tagging, and summary generation.
- [Repository overview](../README.md) – describes how this pack relates to the testing-focused prompt sets.

## Workflow outputs

- Write epics and user stories to `docs/tests/agile-requirements.md` in the project you are documenting.
- Revisit that file as you tag coverage status, add orphaned-code notes, and polish the final stakeholder summary.
