# Awesome Prompts

Modular prompt packs for engineering workflows: reverse requirements, testing, static analysis, and architecture review. Each pack is a repeatable, scope-bound workflow for AI or human agents.

## Prompt Packs
- `TESTING.md` — map test suites, log uncovered scenarios, and iteratively close coverage gaps.  
- `REQUIREMENTS.md` — reverse-engineer code/tests into agile requirements with early non-functional capture.  
- `STATIC_ANALYSIS.md` — inventory linters/tools, baseline findings, plan and execute remediations.  
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — map flows and dependencies, capture risks, and enforce architectural quality.

## How to Use
1. Open the relevant prompt pack and follow the numbered steps in order.  
2. Respect the **Scope** callouts in each step (read/write boundaries, allowed files).  
3. Capture outputs in the specified doc paths to keep findings repeatable and auditable.

## Contributing
- Follow the formatting and prompt-engineering standards in `AGENTS.md`.  
- Keep prompts deterministic, actionable, and explicit about scope and outputs.  
- Submit small, focused changes; avoid adding dependencies or non-prompt artifacts.
