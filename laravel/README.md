# Laravel Prompt Pack

Use this folder when you need to inspect a Laravel application's tests and identify missing business logic coverage. The prompts focus on the conventional `tests/` directory and related source code.

## Quick links

- [Prompt script](./prompts.md) – guides the gap analysis, uncovered checklist creation, and targeted implementation steps.
- [Repository overview](../README.md) – context on how this pack complements the KMP and requirements workflows.

## Workflow outputs

- Document uncovered scenarios in `tests/uncovered.md` inside the Laravel project you are reviewing.
- Any added tests should live under the project's `tests/` directory as directed in the prompts.
